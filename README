This plugin provides a Command that toggles the activation of the global 
JDT save actions (Shift+Ctrl+# / Shift+Cmd+# on Mac).
It also contributes a Toolbar icon that represents the current state of the 
save actions.

The activation of the command and the state of the icon changes depending on the
current active Java editor. When the project of the current file has save actions enabled,
the command will be deactivated and the setting cannot be switched.
